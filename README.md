# About

The Acamar framework is not intended as a full stack framework and it will never be one. It's meant to be used as a base
for APIs and simple websites. For more complex websites (like admin back-ends) it can very well be used in conjunction
with a full stack framework.

# Main selling points
* Event based architecture
* Light and fast
* Flexible
