# About

The Acamar framework is not intended as a full stack framework and it will never be one. It's meant to be used as a base
for APIs and simple websites. For more complex websites (like admin back-ends) it can very well be used in conjunction
with a full stack framework.

# Main selling points
* Event based architecture
* Light and fast
* Flexible

# Documentation

The documentation can be found [HERE](http://acamar.no-ip.biz)

# Composer

The framework can also be installed via composer:

    {
        "require": {
                "brian978/acamar": "dev-master"
            }
    }

# Starter application

The framework uses a specific file structure (which can be found in the documentation).
If you don't want to create the structure manually you can use the skeleton application
from [HERE](https://github.com/brian978/Acamar-SkeletonApplication).
